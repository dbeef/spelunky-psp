# Sproutline

A small single-file library for sprite outline extraction and simplification for C/C++.

**Input:** Sprite with an alpha channel.

**Output:** All the outline paths (simplified, if necessary) for objects in the sprite image.

*'sproutline.h'* is the whole library.
It follows the stb philosophy.
Everything else here is example code, an example image and this readme.
