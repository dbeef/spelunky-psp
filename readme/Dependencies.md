# Dependencies

### Bundled

For convenience majority of dependencies are bundled inside the repository and there is no need to download and build
them separately. All of them are placed under `/vendor` directory, not including [atlasc](https://github.com/septag/atlasc),
which is placed under `/tools/atlasc`, and is a development tool - a texture packer.

In some cases, custom changes were applied to either CMake files or other sources to make them compile and link under
PSP's standard C library which utilizes newlib as a libc implementation. In consequence of using non-GNU libc, 
PSP's C++ standard library is stripped of some symbols, i.e `std::to_string`.

For this compatibility reason, I could not use most of C++ 14 libraries and fell back to using plain C libs, i.e
using cjson instead of [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).

### Platform-specific

The only external dependency so far is SDL.
 
SDL 1.2.15 / SDL_mixer 1.2 on PSP/Linux/Windows, SDL 2.0.9 on Android.

Why SDL 1.2.15 instead of SDL2.x.x? At the time I started working on the Spelunky PSP, 
the [PSP toolchain](https://github.com/pspdev/psptoolchain) shipped only this version, and I was happy to use it as
it is still better than to directly access platform-specific libraries. 

As using legacy SDL set a precedent, I decided to utilize it on every other platform, yet this is not obligatory and I am
planning to move on to SDL2 at least on generic Linux/Windows platforms.

Android does not utilize any version of SDL_mixer as for technical reasons audio module is right now disabled for Android.
I had difficulties cross-compiling SDL_mixer using included Android.mk file, and choose to postpone it as Android support isn't of high priority.
